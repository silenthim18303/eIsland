# Frontend Architecture

:::info
This section documents the eIsland desktop application's frontend architecture, including the Electron multi-process model and the state machine that drives the island's visual behavior.
:::

## Overview

The eIsland frontend is built on Electron's multi-process architecture with a strict separation between the **Main Process** (Node.js), the **Preload Bridge** (Context Bridge), and the **Renderer Process** (Chromium). The core of the application is a state machine that manages **17 distinct states** controlling the island's appearance, expansion, and interaction behavior.
