# HardwareListSnapshot

:::info Introduction
`HardwareListSnapshot` is a data structure returned by [`getHardwareList()`](./get-hardware-list.md). It provides a snapshot of all detected CPU and GPU hardware devices on the system, powered by the Libre Hardware Monitor backend. Use this interface to enumerate available hardware before querying per-device metrics such as temperature readings.
:::

## Interface Introduction

You receive a `HardwareListSnapshot` object every time you call `getHardwareList()`. It tells you whether the hardware detection backend is available, and lists all discovered CPUs and GPUs as [`HardwareDevice`](./hardware-device.md) arrays. This is the entry point for mapping temperature readings (from [`TemperatureReading`](./temperature-reading.md)) back to the physical hardware they belong to.

```ts
// The shape returned by getHardwareList()
interface HardwareListSnapshot {
  isAvailable: boolean;        // true if Libre Hardware Monitor backend responded
  cpus: HardwareDevice[];      // all detected CPU devices
  gpus: HardwareDevice[];      // all detected GPU devices
}
```

## Usage

The typical workflow is:

1. Call `getHardwareList()` to obtain the snapshot.
2. Check `isAvailable` — if `false`, the backend is not running or lacks permissions.
3. Iterate over `cpus` and `gpus` to discover hardware identifiers.
4. Use the device `id` values to correlate with temperature readings from `getTemperature()`.

:::tip Combine with Temperature Data
After retrieving the hardware list, cross-reference the `id` of each device with `TemperatureReading.id` from `getTemperature()` to attach thermal data to specific hardware.
:::

:::note Backend Availability
`isAvailable` is `false` when Libre Hardware Monitor is not installed, not running, or the process lacks administrative privileges. Always guard your code with this check before accessing the arrays.
:::

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `isAvailable` | `boolean` | Whether the Libre Hardware Monitor backend is available and responsive. |
| `cpus` | [`HardwareDevice[]`](./hardware-device.md) | Array of detected CPU hardware devices. May be empty even when `isAvailable` is `true` if no CPUs were enumerable. |
| `gpus` | [`HardwareDevice[]`](./hardware-device.md) | Array of detected GPU hardware devices. May be empty even when `isAvailable` is `true` if no GPUs were enumerable. |

:::warning Empty Arrays
When `isAvailable` is `true`, the `cpus` and `gpus` arrays are still guaranteed to be valid arrays, but they may be empty. Always check `.length` before accessing elements by index.

## Example

::: code-tabs

@tab TypeScript

```ts
import { getHardwareList } from '@eisland/windows-performance-monitor';

// Retrieve the current hardware list snapshot
const hw = getHardwareList();

// Check if the backend is available
if (!hw.isAvailable) {
  console.log('Hardware detection unavailable — check Libre Hardware Monitor');
} else {
  // Iterate over detected CPUs
  for (const cpu of hw.cpus) {
    // Each device has an id, name, category, and hardwareType
    console.log(`CPU: ${cpu.name} (${cpu.hardwareType}), id=${cpu.id}`);
  }

  // Iterate over detected GPUs
  for (const gpu of hw.gpus) {
    console.log(`GPU: ${gpu.name} (${gpu.hardwareType}), id=${gpu.id}`);
  }

  // Summary counts
  console.log(`Total: ${hw.cpus.length} CPU(s), ${hw.gpus.length} GPU(s)`);
}
```

@tab JavaScript

```js
const { getHardwareList } = require('@eisland/windows-performance-monitor');

// Retrieve the current hardware list snapshot
const hw = getHardwareList();

// Check if the backend is available
if (!hw.isAvailable) {
  console.log('Hardware detection unavailable — check Libre Hardware Monitor');
} else {
  // Iterate over detected CPUs
  for (const cpu of hw.cpus) {
    // Each device has an id, name, category, and hardwareType
    console.log(`CPU: ${cpu.name} (${cpu.hardwareType}), id=${cpu.id}`);
  }

  // Iterate over detected GPUs
  for (const gpu of hw.gpus) {
    console.log(`GPU: ${gpu.name} (${gpu.hardwareType}), id=${gpu.id}`);
  }

  // Summary counts
  console.log(`Total: ${hw.cpus.length} CPU(s), ${hw.gpus.length} GPU(s)`);
}
```

## Notes

:::note Source Field
Every [`HardwareDevice`](./hardware-device.md) in the snapshot has `source: 'libre-hardware-monitor'`. This is a constant identifying the data origin and can be used for filtering if multiple data sources are introduced in the future.
:::

:::tip Polling Frequency
`getHardwareList()` performs a lightweight enumeration each time it is called. It is safe to call at moderate intervals (e.g. every few seconds), but avoid tight polling loops as hardware enumeration still involves IPC with the backend process.
:::

:::note Correlating with Temperature Data
Use the `id` field from each `HardwareDevice` to match against `TemperatureReading.id` returned by `getTemperature()`. This allows you to display temperature values alongside the correct hardware device name.
:::

## Danger Avoidance

:::danger Always Check `isAvailable`
Accessing `cpus` or `gpus` when `isAvailable` is `false` returns empty arrays, so it will not crash — but your application logic will silently receive no hardware data. Always gate feature UI behind the `isAvailable` check to avoid presenting a blank screen to the user.
:::

:::danger Administrative Privileges
Libre Hardware Monitor requires elevated privileges to access low-level hardware sensors. If the application is not running with administrator rights, `isAvailable` will be `false` and no hardware or temperature data will be returned. Ensure your application requests the necessary permissions or guides the user accordingly.
