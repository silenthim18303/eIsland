# BrightnessInfo

:::info
`BrightnessInfo` is a data structure returned by the [getBrightness](./get-brightness.md) function. It contains the current screen brightness percentage, an optional list of supported brightness levels, and the display monitor's instance name. You never construct this object yourself — it comes from querying the system's WMI brightness provider.
:::

## Interface Introduction

You encounter `BrightnessInfo` whenever you call `getBrightness()`. The returned object tells you the brightness right now, which discrete levels the display supports (if reported by hardware), and which physical monitor the data came from. If no compatible WMI display is found, `getBrightness()` returns `null` instead.

```ts
export interface BrightnessInfo {
  /** Current brightness percentage (0-100) */
  currentBrightness: number;
  /** Display-supported brightness levels (0-100), null if unavailable */
  levels: number[] | null;
  /** Display monitor instance name, null if unavailable */
  instanceName: string | null;
}
```

## Usage

Call `getBrightness()` to receive a `BrightnessInfo` object or `null`. The `currentBrightness` field is always populated when the object is non-null. The `levels` and `instanceName` fields may be `null` depending on the display hardware and WMI support.

:::tip Use `currentBrightness` for quick checks
If you only need the current brightness value, access `currentBrightness` directly — no need to inspect the other fields. The value is always a whole number between 0 and 100 inclusive.
:::

```ts
import { getBrightness } from '@eisland/windows-brightness-helper';

// Receive a BrightnessInfo object or null
const info = getBrightness();
```

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `currentBrightness` | `number` | Current brightness percentage (0-100) |
| `levels` | `number[] \| null` | Supported brightness levels (0-100), `null` if unavailable |
| `instanceName` | `string \| null` | Display monitor instance name, `null` if unavailable |

:::note `levels` may be empty or null
The `levels` field is `null` when the display does not report its supported brightness steps through WMI. Even when non-null, the array may be empty on certain hardware. Always guard before calling array methods like `.length` or `.includes()`.
:::

:::tip Use `instanceName` to identify the monitor
On multi-monitor setups, `instanceName` lets you distinguish which physical display the brightness data belongs to. Store it if you need to correlate brightness queries across sessions.

## Example

::: code-tabs

@tab TypeScript

```ts
import { getBrightness } from '@eisland/windows-brightness-helper';

// Query the current screen brightness
const info = getBrightness();

// getBrightness() returns null when no WMI-compatible display is found
if (info) {
  // currentBrightness is a whole number from 0 to 100
  console.log(`Brightness: ${info.currentBrightness}%`);

  // levels lists discrete steps the display supports; may be null
  if (info.levels) {
    console.log(`Supported levels: ${info.levels.join(', ')}`);
  }

  // instanceName identifies the physical monitor; may be null
  if (info.instanceName) {
    console.log(`Monitor: ${info.instanceName}`);
  }
} else {
  // No WMI-compatible display detected
  console.log('Brightness info unavailable');
}
```

@tab JavaScript

```js
const { getBrightness } = require('@eisland/windows-brightness-helper');

// Query the current screen brightness
const info = getBrightness();

// getBrightness() returns null when no WMI-compatible display is found
if (info) {
  // currentBrightness is a whole number from 0 to 100
  console.log(`Brightness: ${info.currentBrightness}%`);

  // levels lists discrete steps the display supports; may be null
  if (info.levels) {
    console.log(`Supported levels: ${info.levels.join(', ')}`);
  }

  // instanceName identifies the physical monitor; may be null
  if (info.instanceName) {
    console.log(`Monitor: ${info.instanceName}`);
  }
} else {
  // No WMI-compatible display detected
  console.log('Brightness info unavailable');
}
```

## Notes

:::note Multiple displays
If the system has multiple monitors, `getBrightness()` returns brightness data for the primary WMI-compatible display. The `instanceName` field identifies which monitor the data belongs to. Use [BrightnessMonitor](./brightness-monitor.md) to track changes on the same display.
:::

:::note WMI dependency
`BrightnessInfo` data comes from Windows WMI (`WmiMonitorBrightness`). Systems where WMI is disabled or where the display driver does not expose brightness data through WMI will always return `null` from `getBrightness()`.
:::

:::tip Combining with `setBrightness`
After reading `currentBrightness` from a `BrightnessInfo` object, you can pass a new value to [setBrightness](./set-brightness.md) to adjust the screen. The value range is the same 0-100 scale used by `currentBrightness`.
:::

## Danger Avoidance

:::danger Do not assume `getBrightness()` always returns a value
`getBrightness()` returns `null` when no WMI-compatible display is detected — this happens with external monitors connected via non-WMI interfaces, virtual displays, or systems with WMI disabled. Accessing `.currentBrightness` on `null` throws a `TypeError`. Always check for `null` before reading any property.
:::

:::danger Do not mutate the returned object
The `BrightnessInfo` object returned by `getBrightness()` is meant to be read-only. Mutating its properties has no effect on the actual screen brightness and may cause confusion if the object is referenced elsewhere. Use [setBrightness](./set-brightness.md) to change brightness.
