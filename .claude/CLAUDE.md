## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

Before any uncertain operation:
- If an operation could be risky, ambiguous, or has unclear impact, pause and ask the user before proceeding.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Agent Prompt Sync (Global Rule)

**When feature scope changes, agent prompts must be updated in the same task.**

- If you add/remove/change any user-facing eIsland feature, also sync corresponding agent prompt descriptions in `eisland-server/server`.
- Treat prompt sync as part of Definition of Done; do not mark the task complete if prompts are stale.
- At minimum, verify all affected prompt builders mention the new capability consistently.
- If uncertain which prompts are affected, explicitly ask and confirm before finishing.

## 6. i18n Completeness (UI Change Gate)

**Every user-facing string must have translations. No exceptions.**

After any UI change (new component, new text, modified labels, new feedback messages):
1. Scan all `t('...')` calls in changed files for translation keys.
2. Check both `i18n/zh-CN.json` and `i18n/en-US.json` — every key must exist in both.
3. If a key is missing, add it to both files before marking the task done.
4. Hard-coded Chinese/English strings in UI code are forbidden — wrap them in `t()`.

Verification: `grep -rn "defaultValue" src/renderer/components/<changed-dir>/` should show `t()` wrappers, not raw strings.

## 7. Comment Standards (Code Change Gate)

**All code must comply with [`docs/COMMENT_STANDARDS.md`](docs/COMMENT_STANDARDS.md). No exceptions.**

## 8. Frontend Standards (Code Change Gate)

**All frontend code must comply with [`docs/FRONTEND_STANDARDS.md`](docs/FRONTEND_STANDARDS.md). No exceptions.**

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
